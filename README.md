### Description

Hey, the name's Skinny. You feelin' lucky? This NPC will allow players to gamble copper, silver, or gold as
defined in the configuration. It's a nice way for players to make a little extra coin.

- Config:
    - Set bet and jackpot amounts
    - Enable/Disable coin type (gold, silver, copper)
    - Set coin type to gamble
- A roll of 50 or higher wins double the bet!
- A roll of less than 50 loses double the bet!
- A roll of 100 within the first 10 rolls hits the jackpot!
- The jackpot can only be hit in the first 10 rolls of each session to discourage spam.
- A little help is given to players losing 5 rolls in a row.

- Create lottery from player losses.
